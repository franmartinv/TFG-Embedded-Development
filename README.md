# Final Degree Project about Embedded Systems development with MCU ESP32

## Note from the Author

Hi everyone!!

This is my Final Degree Project of Electronic Industry and Automatic Engineering at University of Almer√≠a (Spain).

This project is based on MQTT and TCP/IP connection to a online server, reading and sending several sensors' data like temperature, pressure or humidity...

These sensors are: MS5611, BME680, and CCS811.

I have programmed a ESP32-CAM too!! You can see the C main project code in my profile!

You can see the project of each sensor in my Github profile!

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This project can be execute in every ESP32.

It needs a MS5611, BME680 and CCS811 sensor.

### Configure the project

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) with ESP-IDF terminal.
* Configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet under "Example Connection Configuration" menu. Type here your SSID and your password.
* Go then to "Example Configuration" and type your MQTT broker URL.
* When using Make build system, set `Default serial port` under `Serial flasher config`.
* In the same ESP-IDF terminal type: (`idf.py -p COMx flash monitor`) to execute this project.
* Only enjoy it ;-) !!

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
